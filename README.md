# MultiAgent_Using_CrewAI
This mini-project uses CrewAI to read and process the content of every video on a YouTube channel, enabling users to ask questions and get accurate answers. It leverages AI-powered transcription, summarization, and contextual search to provide instant, relevant responses from an entire channelâ€™s video library.
